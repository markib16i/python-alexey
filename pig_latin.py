"""If a word starts with a consonant, move the first consonant (or group of consonants) to the end and add “ay”.

    Example:

        dog → ogday

        school → oolschay

If a word starts with a vowel, just add “way” or “yay” to the end.

    Example:

        apple → appleway

        orange → orangeway
